# SPEC-debris-barrier-platform

# SPEC-debris-barrier script

use the python file (SPEC_debris_barrier_platform_v8_10.py) to run:

	SPEC-debris model
	
	optimal closed and open-type barrier location selection model 
		
	closed and open-type barrier performance evaluation

to request for a software GUI version (refer to SPEC_debris_barrier_platform_GUI.png) and/or user manual (written in PhD Thesis by Enok Cheon),
please send a request through e-mail:
